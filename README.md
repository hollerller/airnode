## What is AirNode?

AirNode is a low-power environmental sensor that measures air quality in real time and streams data to a mobile app via BLE and MQTT over WiFi.

It is designed as a complete end-to-end IoT product — from embedded firmware to cloud backend to cross-platform mobile app.

## Features

- 🌡️ Temperature, humidity and pressure (BME680)
- 💨 PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter (PMS5003)
- 📱 iOS and Android app — real-time dashboard, historical charts, device config
- 🔵 BLE provisioning — connect and configure the device from the app
- ☁️ MQTT data pipeline with cloud backend
- 🔋 Ultra low-power design — target <50 µA average current
- 🔄 OTA firmware updates
